About this project
This project is a blog application that covers typical blogging features. It lets users read posts, browse by category, search content, and view details of individual posts. The admin area supports post creation, editing, and management with a secure authentication layer. The app uses a modular approach to grouping related functionality into cohesive modules. The goal is to provide a practical, readable example that balances simplicity with real-world considerations.

Key features

  - You can customize the docker-compose file to tune ports, volumes, or environment
  - Common commands:
    - docker-compose up -d
    - docker-compose ps
    - docker-compose logs
    - docker-compose down

- Database migrations with Flyway
  - Flyway is integrated to manage the database schema
  - Migrations are placed in src/main/resources/db/migration
  - On startup, Flyway scans these scripts and applies them in order
  - Each migration file follows the standard naming convention V<version>__<description>.sql
  - You can also run Flyway manually if you need to apply migrations outside the app
  - Keeping migrations in version control ensures the database evolves in lockstep with code

- Security model
  - The app uses Spring Security to enforce authentication and authorization
  - Roles define access: user-level access for public features, admin roles for content management
  - Passwords are hashed using a secure algorithm
  - Security configuration allows future extension to OAuth, SAML, or other providers if needed
  - CSRF protection and session management are enabled by default
